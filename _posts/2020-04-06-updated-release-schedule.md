All of us in the Fyne community hope your friends, families, and colleagues are well.
This is a difficult time for everyone and we appreciate the support of our
sponsors and community members to keep the project pushing forward.

## Impact on planned releases

Unfortunately a number of our core development team have been unwell and/or had to look after
family members over the last months. We know that a lot of teams have been impacted
by the recent outbreaks around the world and our thoughts are with them.
Hopefully those of you who are relying on Fyne for their software development will
understand as we re-structure our plans to accommodate ongoing uncertainty.

The largest impact on our delivery plans is that the data binding feature which we know
people have been waiting for will not be in the next feature release.
We are sorry for
any inconvenience this causes and aim to create an additional feature release as soon as
we feel ready to release this large piece of work.

## More contributors helping out

Amidst the difficulties we are incredibly thankful to a number of developers who are
choosing to spend some of their spare time contributing to the project.
As a result we have many new widgets and features that we are excited to share!

So that larger items of work do not hold back the release of these new features we have
updated our plans to be able to publish feature releases more regularly.
After releasing v1.2.4 next week we will be aiming for feature releases every
two months instead of three.

## Release Plan

The following table is a summary of the main milestones we expect in the next 6 months,
with dates where we feel confident in predicting them.

| **#** | **Date** | **Content** |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1.2.4 | 13 April | Mobile fixes for screen size, preferences storage and bug fixes for packaging and window management |
| 1.3   | 4 May    | File dialogs, notifications, many new widgets |
| 2.0   | July     | Data binding, animations, drag and drop |
| 3.0   | TBD      | Multimedia, UI designer, Localisation |

Our thanks to the ongoing support of our sponsors, community members and the wider
open source movement - without their help this project would not be possible. Be well and stay safe.
