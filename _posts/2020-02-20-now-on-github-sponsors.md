Today the Fyne team are celebrating because we have been accepted onto the 
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) programme!
A number of our developers have been receiving sponsorship for a few months
(thanks very much to all of those who supported their time on the project).
Now that we have organisation approval it means that you can 
[sponsor the whole team](https://github.com/sponsors/fyne-io)
for the ongoing work we do as a group.

For small contributions your funding will support general expenses of the
project - web hosting, event costs and promotional materials (and stickers!).
For sponsors who are kind enough to support feature development or bug fixing
we will make sure that 75% of your contribution goes to the core developers
who do the work, making sure that everyone benefits.

If any of our followers like what we are doing and are compelled to support
us we thank you very much in advance! Your contribution is highly valued
and is an important part of ensuring the continued success of the Fyne project.
