After a lot of hard work from a dedicated team we are excited to announce
release 1.4 of they Fyne toolkit. This is a huge update with some
great new functionality and it paves the way for some bigger changes
in 2.0 early in 2021.

Nearly 700 commits from 15 different contributors has made this a bumper
release. A comprehensive list of new features appears later, but first
let's explore two big changes.

## Theme update

For the first time since the initial public release we took the
opportunity to refresh the standard theme. For 1.4 we have updated the 
color scheme to better reflect standard material design colors and to
use the same primary color on light and dark mode themes. We have also
included an update to the fyne_demo app that is better able to show off
all the new features that come as standard in this latest release.

Not only does this update provide a more vibrant look and feel to all 
applications but it enabled us to allow users to choose alternative 
primary colors to suit their tastes.
This selection can be made through the fyne_settings app or the 
File->Settings menu item in fyne_demo.

## Collection widgets

The 1.4 release brings many new widgets to Fyne, but the biggest of those
are the new *collection* widgets - List, Table and Tree.
When looking at the existing widget set we realised that showing large amounts of
data was not well supported, and so we set out to change this.

<img src="/blog/img/list-dark.png" width="182" />
<img src="/blog/img/table-light.png" width="182" />
<img src="/blog/img/tree-dark.png" width="182" />

The collection widgets combine caching and a data abstraction that allow them to
provide high performance presentation for very large datasets. They can handle many
thousands of data rows with different arrangements based on widget. List will show one
dimensional data, Table is for two dimensions (rows and columns) and the Tree can
show data with a hierarchical structure. Their performance is based on what is 
currently on screen - the rest of the dataset is not read until scrolled into view.

Each widget has a similar API design for querying the data size and configuring 
presentation. The List widget, for example, requires a developer to provide the
following functions (normally passed in the `NewList()` constructor):

```go
	Length       func() int
	CreateItem   func() fyne.CanvasObject
	UpdateItem   func(id ListItemID, item fyne.CanvasObject)
```

In this example Length returns the number of rows to display. Each time a new graphical
item is required (for setup or if the widget expands) the `CreateItem` will be called and
the developer should return a *template* `CanvasObject`. When data will be displayed the
`UpdateItem` will be called, specifying the data index to lookup and the template object
that should be configured.

This is a big step forward for complex application use-cases and we can't
wait to see what the community builds with the new functionality.
There are many great new features also included in this release, see the full list below.

## Release notes

The following is a list of highlights of what is included in this release. As you can see
there are a number of APIs that have been deprecated
(see "Changed" below) many of which already have new replacements.
Some of the deprecated areas are in preparation for some big changes 
in the 2.0 release that we are now working towards.
