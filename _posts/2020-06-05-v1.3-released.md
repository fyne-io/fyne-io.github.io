It is finally here, the 1.3 release is out and ready for you to start building against!
If you were waiting for file dialogs, notifications, accordian, splitter or textgrid widgets this is your lucky day. You can also find new APIs for showing splash windows, image scaling and the ability
to set cursor and keyboard hints in custom widgets.

This release includes over 1000 commits and represents months of very hard work. Our dedicated
contributors have balanced coding, testing and all the challenges that life in lockdown threw at them
as well.

Hopefully there is something for everyone in this big update to the Fyne toolkit.
We will be working over the coming weeks to create new tutorials and examples of how these
new features can support building more complete applications without having to worry
about platform specific code.
