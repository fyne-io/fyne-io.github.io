For anyone who is new to the Fyne community you might not know that earlier this month we held the 2023 [Fyne Conf](https://conf.fyne.io) event.
What was super exciting was that this year we held the first hybrid event, with people joining us in person and online.
It was a fantastic opportunity to gather with the community. We had half of the
core contributor team, around 10 people in person and over 200 joining us live online!
Everyone who arrived in person (or presented remotely) was treated to one of
our limited edition Fyne Conf 2023 t-shirts (only 3 people have one from each
year they were produced!).

Thanks to the kind people at [CodeBase](https://thisiscodebase.com) we were
hosted in a comfortable event space in the center of Edinburgh, Scotland.
(And check out that banner we had!)
There was also a great breakfast and lunch provided by [Tasty Buns Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/TastyBunsBakeryEdinburgh/?locale=en_GB).
Also some drinks were enjoyed as we wrapped up, and all the food and drink
was sponsored by [Fyne Labs](https://fynelabs.com), thanks :).

Of course this was all just an excellent backdrop to a morning of workshops
and an afternoon packed full of presentations. You can see all the recordings
our our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F8_Xw_5zG4&list=PLjpijTpXl1_pD8663I9ztUHocyG0geTiD).
It was amazing to have so many contributions from around the community - it 
was our largest programme to date!

Thanks to everyone who came along in person, and to the hundreds online. 
Also thanks to everyone catching up after the event and joining the community
channels to learn more. We are already planning next year and considering 
meeting up in Germany - see you there!
