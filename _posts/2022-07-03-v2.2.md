It's been a long time coming, but we are thrilled to share the v2.2.0 release.
There are so many amazing features added this release, not least system tray
for desktop apps, app metadata, iOS simulator support and initial version of
a driver for running apps through a web browser.
Also check out the improved menu experience and support for more BSD OSes
as well as support for Google Play .aab file format.

## Added features

Lots of new features come with this release, but here is a dhow of the system
tray feature - it will adapt to the operating system the app is running on.

You can get started as simply as:

```go
	if desk, ok := a.(desktop.App); ok {
		m := fyne.NewMenu("MyApp",
			fyne.NewMenuItem("Hello", func() {
				log.Println("Hello")
			}))
		desk.SetSystemTrayMenu(m)
	}
```

Don't forget to set an application icon, which is used by default.
Or you can update to specific tray icon with `SetSystemTrayIcon`.

Also this release is the first chance to try running your Fyne app through a web browser
window. You can try this out (make sure you update fyne command first!):

```
$ fyne serve
Serving myapp/web on HTTP port: 8080
```
And just load your web browser!

Note that at this time the web driver cannot handle multiple windows or
the use of storage or preference code.
