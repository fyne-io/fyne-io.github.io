We are excited to announce the bumper v2.4.0 release - later than we hoped, but well worth the delay.
With the introduction of rounded rectangles we have updated the look and feel to remove a lot of the sharp corners,
Smoother edges to input and buttons primarily make the UI feel a lot more friendly.
Check out the full release below and let us know what you think :)
