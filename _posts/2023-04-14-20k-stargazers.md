Can you believe it?! Our humble GUI project has reached 20'000 stargazers?
What a journey this has been. In the last 5 years we have created something incredible.
Fyne is now the most popular GUI toolkit for Go; the 6th most used of all open source GUI toolkits from any language; and if you want to avoid using HTML/CSS/JS in your app then we are third behind only Flutter and React Native!
(See OSS Insight month-to-month [Cross-Platform GUI tool](https://ossinsight.io/collections/cross-platform-gui-tool/)

Thanks so much to our wonderful community, the contributors and collaborators on this project. And to you, for your interest and in helping us spread the word!
