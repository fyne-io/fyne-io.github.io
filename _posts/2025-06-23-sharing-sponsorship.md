The Fyne project and community continues to grow thanks to the many contributions from people around the world.
Of course an endeavour of this size would not be possible without the hard work of teams that have created essential re-usable components that we can build upon.
It's for that reason that we want to be able to give something back to those projects that make each of our releases possible.

## Giving back to our open source friends

As a project that benefits from sponsorship by those that appreciate our work, we are
keen to make sure that others less visible are thanked for their effort and hours of dedication.
Going forwards the Fyne project commits to allocating **20%** of the sponsorship revenue we receive with the projects that we depend upon.
Much like GitHub sponsors these sponsorship monies will be shared with established projects that are able to accept a financial transfer and allocate the funds appropriately.
Our group of core contributors will agree on the projects that we support, reviewed on a regular basis to accomodate changes in our dependencies.

## When will this happen?

As soon as possible! But there are a few formalities with any commercial activity.

1. Projects we support will be depended upon by the core Fyne library
2. They will be actively maintained
3. Fyne sponsor income must be above $1000 

The list above aims to ensure that we will support projects that are great open source citizens
and that those we support (aiming to be at least 5) are all being sent sufficient to be worth the effort.

And so with that, please consider adding your [sponsorship to Fyne](http://github.com/sponsors/fyne-io),
knowing that your contribution will be shared with more projects that make your app possible!
