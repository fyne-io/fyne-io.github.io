Whatever you celebrate at this time of year we hope you will enjoy this exciting, shiny new look release of the Fyne toolkit.
With a refined design, cloud integration, images in rich text and a new text handling engine there is a lot to love in Fyne v2.3.0.

### New Look

We have refined the visual design of Fyne in this release to give a better
initial experience for app users. You can see the new design shown below
in the fyne_demo app.

### Cloud integration

You can now easily add cloud storage to any Fyne app through the `App.Preferences()`
and `App.Storage()` abstractions. This change will be completely transparent
to the rest of your app, and is as simple as calling `App.SetCloudProvider()`.

There is a lot more information from the cloud sync presentation at
[Fyne Conf 2022](https://conf.fyne.io).
