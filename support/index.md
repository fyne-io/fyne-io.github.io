### Getting Started

We know that exploring a new technology can be confusing, even if you
have explored [the tour](https://tour.fyne.io) and read
[the documentation ](https://fyne.io/develop/). We are happy to help with any
questions you have about getting set up, building your first app or how the APIs work.

The best place to ask is in the
[#fyne](https://gophers.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=fyne) channel on the
"gophers" slack server (you can [sign up](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
if you need). This is where we gather to discuss the project, examples and help
anyone with questions they might have.

### Ask a Question

For those who are up and running with their Fyne based application you may be
wondering how to improve your code. Whether you'd like to increase your test
coverage, bundle application resources or start working on custom widgets
then the community can offer some help.

Simply join us on the [#fyne](https://gophers.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=fyne) 
gophers Slack channel or [Fyne Discord](https://discord.gg/vvBuDfD5gP)
and let us know your question. Be prepared to share your source
code (easy for open source projects) for the best answers. When that is not
possible then pasting a snippet or example to the Go 
[playground](https://play.golang.org/) can be very helpful.

### Commercial support

If your business would like some dedicated support time or would like to
out-source the development of your application then we recommend speaking to
[Fyne Labs](https://fynelabs.com/).

Fyne Labs is the business that manages support and funding for the Fyne project -
and as experts in this technology they are able to offer development support
and bespoke app creation.
The team can be [contacted](https://fynelabs.com/#post-39) through their website.
