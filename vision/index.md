## Our Vision
<hr class="light">

Technology marches on, the number of devices that we interact with is ever increasing and
the number of platforms that they run seems to be exploding.
As the ubiquity of computing expands it becomes even more important to ensure that your
products and solutions are presented to end users on their preferred device
in a way that is familiar to them.

Unfortunately this makes the work of a software development team more 
difficult with each year. Manufacturers push their own platforms and write tools
in their own programming languages.
As a result providing the perfect user experience is almost prohibitively
expensive for small companies who cannot afford the licensing or time required
to deliver on all these platforms.

The Fyne project is based around the premise that it should be free and
simple to develop an application that can run on all platforms without
modification or adaptation.
Fyne apps are installed like regular applications on all platforms and deliver great performance
and solid user experience.
We are targetting the nirvana of 
cross-platform native application development.

## Making this happen
---

We believe that graphical applications should be easy to develop and work across all operating systems. Additionally we feel that an open source approach is a requirement of a new technological foundation,
ensuring that it remains free and open forever.

> Fyne aims to be the best Toolkit for developing beautiful and usable native graphical applications for desktop, mobile and beyond.

Building cross platform graphical applications is complicated and difficult to learn.
The technologies involved are old and therefore carry with them legacy design choices.
Our solution is based on new technologies, best practices and is taking the opportunity
to shed legacy requirements and constraints.
This enables us to support easy to build apps with great user experience
that are also fun to develop and easy to maintain.

## Supporting the project
---

The Fyne project, framework and related apps are all developed and supported
by our excellent team of volunteers and the community.
We are very grateful to everyone who has contributed to the success of the project,
we could not have achieved so much without their involvement.

To support the continued growth of our community and provide ongoing feature development
improvements we continue to ask for donations to the project.
With your support we will be able grow the infrastructure that
underpins our services as well as paying for developers, designers and
the support team to continue to provide the same great product and service as we grow.

If you would like to get involved please head over to our [contribution](/contribute/) page,
sign up as a [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/fyne-io/) or consider
[donating](/sponsor/) directly to the project.

Thank you so much for your interest and support of the Fyne project.
