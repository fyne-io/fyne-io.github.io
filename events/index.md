*31 October 2019 - GopherCon AU (Sydney)*

In this talk, Steve introduces the Fyne GUI toolkit and it's targeting of cross
platform desktop applications, as well as Mobile (Android / iOS) and more.
TDD support is built in, and its written 100% in Go, so you know its good.

This will be a fast paced, highly visual dive through the possibilities for
application development, if you dare to throw out the rulebook and look at a
fresh new approach that the Go tooling makes possible. Attendees will be
challenged to let their imaginations loose, and get excited about writing
"that app" that they have always wanted to finish off one day. Now is your time !
