How Go taught me to love building apps again

Building apps is tough and involves lots of languages to reach multiple platforms - unless you build with Go and let the tools do the hard work! This talk covers the joy I experienced when starting to build graphical apps using Go and how any developer can feel the same with the Fyne toolkit.

### Open Source Summit North America 2023

*11 May 2023 - Vancouver and Online*

Development and distribution of large applications for the desktop is a difficult task as legacy solution have built layers of complexity as the ecosystem evolved over decades. There is no reason that making a native application should be more complex than a web site or a command line tool.

Cedric Bail presents an introduction to Go and its ecosystem to quickly write native command line tools, before introducing Fyne and writing a graphical application. Including unit tests and how to make sure that the code quality is up to standard, remaining readable and maintainable over time.

### Golang Bristol: Go(ne online)

*20 July 2022 - Online*

Nick White - Using Fyne to create beautiful GUIs in idiomatic Go

Nick will talk about using the Fyne toolkit to create native cross-platform desktop and mobile interfaces in pure Go.

We will walk through an example of adding a GUI in Fyne to an existing Go command line program, showing off a variety of widgets and customisation that's possible. We'll talk about the pros and cons of using a toolkit that has been built from the ground up for Go, as opposed to bindings for more well-known toolkits like Qt, GTK or Tk.

### Fun + No Constraints + High Performance = Creativity

*31 October 2019 - GopherCon AU (Sydney)*

In this talk, Steve introduces the Fyne GUI toolkit and it's targeting of cross
platform desktop applications, as well as Mobile (Android / iOS) and more.
TDD support is built in, and its written 100% in Go, so you know its good.

This will be a fast paced, highly visual dive through the possibilities for
application development, if you dare to throw out the rulebook and look at a
fresh new approach that the Go tooling makes possible. Attendees will be
challenged to let their imaginations loose, and get excited about writing
"that app" that they have always wanted to finish off one day. Now is your time !
