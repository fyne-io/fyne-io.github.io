### GopherCon UK

*16 August 2024 - London, UK*

Building Graphical Go apps is Fyne :)

I will show you how to get up and running quickly by building an initial app using barely 10 lines of Go code. From there, I will show off the tooling that Fyne provides to build out a more complete graphical app.

After this talk, you will have the knowledge you need to start using Go to build graphical apps for any platform!

Low code graphical apps with Go top to bottom!

Building apps is hard and addressing multiple platforms is even worse. But with Go, Fyne and Fysion we can get built in no time and distribute for all devices easier than ever. And best is that all the functionality is built with Go, enabling creators to upskill and even learn development whilst building their app.

### Open Source Summit North America 2023

*11 May 2023 - Vancouver and Online*

Development and distribution of large applications for the desktop is a difficult task as legacy solution have built layers of complexity as the ecosystem evolved over decades. There is no reason that making a native application should be more complex than a web site or a command line tool.

Cedric Bail presents an introduction to Go and its ecosystem to quickly write native command line tools, before introducing Fyne and writing a graphical application. Including unit tests and how to make sure that the code quality is up to standard, remaining readable and maintainable over time.

Nick White - Using Fyne to create beautiful GUIs in idiomatic Go

Nick will talk about using the Fyne toolkit to create native cross-platform desktop and mobile interfaces in pure Go.

We will walk through an example of adding a GUI in Fyne to an existing Go command line program, showing off a variety of widgets and customisation that's possible. We'll talk about the pros and cons of using a toolkit that has been built from the ground up for Go, as opposed to bindings for more well-known toolkits like Qt, GTK or Tk.

*31 October 2019 - GopherCon AU (Sydney)*

In this talk, Steve introduces the Fyne GUI toolkit and it's targeting of cross
platform desktop applications, as well as Mobile (Android / iOS) and more.
TDD support is built in, and its written 100% in Go, so you know its good.

This will be a fast paced, highly visual dive through the possibilities for
application development, if you dare to throw out the rulebook and look at a
fresh new approach that the Go tooling makes possible. Attendees will be
challenged to let their imaginations loose, and get excited about writing
"that app" that they have always wanted to finish off one day. Now is your time !
