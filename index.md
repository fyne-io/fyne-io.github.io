                  platform for building graphical applications for desktop, mobile and beyond.
                  Combining the power and simplicity of the Go programming language with an
                 carefully crafted library of widgets it is now easier than ever before to build
                  your application and deploy it across all platforms and stores.

                <p>When Fyne started it was with the ambition to fix all of the complicated or
                  broken things about existing approaches. Building your software with an API
                  like Fyne that is designed for modern languages is easy and quick to learn.
                  Add to this that the toolkit is open source, under the permissive 3 clause BSD
                  license, and will always be freely available you can be confident in a bright
                  future of enjoyable app development.
