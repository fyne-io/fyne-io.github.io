# Fyne.io Website

This repository contains the source of the main https://fyne.io website.

## Running the website locally

The website uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website from markdown files.
With ruby installed it is as easy as running the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
