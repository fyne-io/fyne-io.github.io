## Help Us Build the Future
<hr class="light">

We have a lot of coding to do but that's just the start of it. To build
something that is easy to use takes much more work than something that is
complex. It involves good design, a rigorous testing process and an active
community who can help us find the right solutions

If you like what this project is doing (or aims to achieve) we would welcome
your support. Financial backing is hugely helpful as it allows us to accept
help from people that need to buy food and pay the bills! If you have some
spare time and would like to help provide your skills then thanks to you too!
The main areas of help we are looking for are outlined below.

### Software Engineers

Whether you're into algorithms, widgets, APIs or packaging we love to
welcome new developers. You can see all our code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/fyne-io/) and each repository documents it's
build and test setup.

Go ahead and fork any of the repositories to get started - we use
[GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
for source management so work from the "develop" branch.
<a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">Let us know</a> if you have any
questions, we look forward to your pull requests!

### Designers

Don't you love it when things look polished and well thought out? So do we!
Even though most open source projects are led by engineers we know it could
be better - if you can help us then welcome aboard.

We're looking for theme designers for our UI elements, guidance for layouts
and spacing for the best flow and inspiration in mockups and usability for
our apps. Please 
<a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">get in touch</a> with ideas or questions.

### Testers

Anyone who is interested in building or using quality desktop applications
would be ideal to help us test. It doesn't matter if you've not tested before,
anyone who can recognise great apps would be ideal to help.

 If you can find things that are not quite right or see what could be done
better then excellent! Grab the code or one of our apps and see what you can
find. Ask us anything on our contact forms and please
[file bugs](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues) for us to resolve.

## How we Make Decisions
<hr class="light">

Making decisions quickly is important but we also want to ensure that we've
taken in to account important facts and all viewpoints.
At all times we want to be aligned on the same vision so that coflicting 
opinions are not common and that we're all heading in the same direction.

### Majority 

All large decisions will require majority agreement within the developer community.
As those who make up our community will change over time we consider that any
contributor to the core project software should be included in this decision
making process.

### New Feature Addition

Incremental development or changes that have been agreed upon can be worked
on by any developer, however the addition of new features can lead to
unsupported functionality and so should be considered more carefully.
Therefore significant new features should not be added unless there are at least
2 contributors (assuming at least 3 active contributors) prepared to
support the ongoing development of that feature.
